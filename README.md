# hello-world
finally got on GitHub!!


Hi, I'm a current student working on a bachelors degree in business and minoring 
in computer science and data analytics. I've been learning OO programming with C++ 
and database design with SQL. As a side project, I'd like to take on web-development to
apply all these new skills!
